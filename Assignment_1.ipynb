        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a programming language.\n",
        "  It is popular because of its ease of learning, versatility, extensive libraries, a large and supportive community, and its suitability for various applications, including data science, AI and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - In python. an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        " - These are reserved words in Python with special meaning so interpreter can understand them. They perform specific tasks in python programing and are a part of its syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        " - In python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after it's created. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries can be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - Lists are mutable as lists can be modified, meaning their elements can be changed, added or removed after creation. But tuples are immutable as they cannot be modified after creation. Any attempt to change an element will result in an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - In python \"==\" checks for value equality i.e whether two objects have the same value, while \"is\" checks for object identity i.e whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - Logical operators are used to combile or modify boolean expressions, ultimately returning a boolean value (true or false) based on the truthiness of the input conditions. Ex- and, or, not\n",

        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
