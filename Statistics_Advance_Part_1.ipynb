        "Adjusting for Different Units and Scales\n",
        "When comparing data from different sources (e.g., comparing test scores in two different subjects or sales figures from different stores), Z-scores help to eliminate the effects of different units of measurement or different variability. This way, you're comparing the relative position within each distribution rather than absolute values.\n",

        "Independence of Samples (if sampling without replacement)\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're sampling without replacement, the sample size should be small relative to the population size. Specifically, the sample size should be less than 10% of the population size to ensure that the samples are approximately independent. This is often referred to as the \"10% condition.\"\n",
