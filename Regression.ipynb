        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        " - Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - One independent variable (predictor or input), usually denoted as X\n",
        "\n",
        "    - One dependent variable (response or output), usually denoted as Y\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (called the regression line) that predicts the value of Y based on X.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        " - The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are critical for ensuring that the model provides valid and reliable results.\n",
        "\n",
        " ✅ 1. Linearity\n",
        "What it means: There is a linear relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to check: Use a scatter plot. The points should form a roughly straight-line pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 2. Independence of Errors (No Autocorrelation)\n",
        "What it means: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it's violated: Often a problem in time series data (e.g., stock prices).\n",
        "\n",
        "How to check: Plot residuals over time or use the Durbin-Watson test.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "What it means: The residuals have constant variance across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "If violated: You get heteroscedasticity, which can lead to biased standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to check: Plot residuals vs. predicted values — the spread should be roughly even.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "What it means: The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed, especially for making confidence intervals or hypothesis tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to check: Use a histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals.\n",
        "\n",

        "This mainly applies to multiple linear regression, but in simple linear regression:\n",

        " - Heteroscedasticity refers to the condition in regression analysis where the variance of the residuals (errors) is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. In simpler terms, the spread or “scatter” of the errors changes—often increasing or decreasing—as the value of the predictors changes.\n",

        "Creates a new binary (0 or 1) column for each category in the variable.\n",

        "\n",

Linear regression assumes a straight-line (linear) relationship, where the effect of a change in the predictor variable on the response is constant. In contrast, polynomial regression extends this by allowing the relationship to be curved, using higher-degree terms (e.g.,\n",

        "29. What methods can be used to evaluate model fit when selecting the degree of a polynomial?\n",
        " - When selecting the degree of a polynomial regression model, it's important to balance good fit with model simplicity to avoid overfitting. Several methods can help evaluate model fit and guide the choice of polynomial degree:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 1. Adjusted R²\n",
        "What it does: Measures how well the model explains variability adjusted for the number of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it's useful: Unlike R², adjusted R² penalizes excessive complexity, helping identify the optimal degree without overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 2. Cross-Validation (e.g., K-Fold)\n",
        "What it does: Evaluates model performance on multiple training/validation splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it's useful: Provides an unbiased estimate of model performance on unseen data, helping choose the degree that generalizes best.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root MSE (RMSE)\n",
        "On training vs. validation/test sets:\n",
        "\n",
        "Training MSE ↓ but validation MSE ↑ → overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose degree with lowest validation/test MSE\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 4. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) / Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\n",
        "What they do: Balance model fit and complexity by penalizing for more parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why they help: Lower AIC/BIC values indicate a better trade-off between bias and variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "30. Why is visualization important in polynomial regression?\n",
        " - Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding, evaluating, and communicating polynomial regression models. Here's why it's so important:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 1. Reveals the Shape of the Relationship\n",
        "Polynomial regression captures nonlinear trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visual plots help you see the curve and judge whether it appropriately follows the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "🟢 Example:\n",
        "You might find that a quadratic (U-shaped) curve fits better than a straight line — something that’s not obvious from metrics alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 2. Detects Underfitting or Overfitting\n",
        "A too-simple model (e.g., linear) may underfit, missing curves.\n",
        "\n",
        "A too-complex model (e.g., 5th-degree polynomial) may overfit, showing wild oscillations.\n",
        "\n",
        "📊 By plotting predictions vs. actual data, you can visually detect when the curve is too smooth or too wiggly.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Assesses Residual Patterns\n",
        "Residual plots (actual – predicted values) can show whether:\n",
        "\n",
        "Residuals are randomly scattered → Good fit\n",
        "\n",
        "Residuals form patterns → Model is missing structure\n",
        "\n",
        "👀 Helps decide whether a higher-degree polynomial is needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 4. Communicates Model Behavior\n",
        "Graphs are intuitive — they translate math into meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stakeholders can quickly grasp how the model behaves, especially in non-technical contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 5. Visualizes Extrapolation Risks\n",
        "Polynomial curves can behave erratically outside the data range.\n",
        "\n",
        "A graph makes it easy to see if the curve shoots off unrealistically at the edges.\n",
