        "1. What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        " - Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems — where the output or target variable is categorical and typically takes values like 0 or 1, yes or no, or true or false.\n",
        "It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category using the logistic (sigmoid) function, which outputs a value between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic regression differs from linear regression in both purpose and function. While linear regression is used to predict continuous numerical values, logistic regression is used for classification tasks, particularly when the outcome is binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). Linear regression estimates a direct relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable using a straight line. In contrast, logistic regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic (sigmoid) function, which compresses the output into a range between 0 and 1. This makes logistic regression suitable for predicting class membership. Additionally, while linear regression uses mean squared error as its loss function, logistic regression uses log loss (cross-entropy) to measure the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels.\n",

        "10. What are some alternatives to Logistic Regression for classification tasks?\n",
        " - There are several alternatives to logistic regression for classification tasks, especially when the data is complex or the assumptions of logistic regression are violated. Decision Trees are a popular non-parametric method that can handle both numerical and categorical data without requiring a linear relationship. Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees, improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by averaging predictions from multiple trees. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are effective in high-dimensional spaces and can model non-linear decision boundaries using kernel functions. For very accurate results, Gradient Boosting methods like XGBoost or LightGBM are often used, as they build strong classifiers by combining many weak ones in a sequential manner. In cases involving text or high-dimensional sparse data, Naive Bayes classifiers offer fast and reliable performance. Neural Networks, especially deep learning models, are powerful alternatives when dealing with complex patterns and large datasets. Each of these models has its own strengths and is better suited to different types of data and classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are Classification Evaluation Metrics?\n",
        " - Classification evaluation metrics help assess how well a classification model performs in predicting class labels. These metrics provide insight into accuracy, error rates, and the model’s ability to distinguish between different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does class imbalance affect Logistic Regression?\n",
        " - Class imbalance occurs when one class (e.g., negatives) greatly outnumbers the other (e.g., positives) in a dataset — for example, 95% class 0 and only 5% class 1. This imbalance can negatively affect logistic regression in several important ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. Bias Toward the Majority Class\n",
        "Logistic regression tends to favor the majority class because it tries to minimize overall error.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, the model might predict the majority class for most inputs, ignoring the minority class entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: It may achieve 95% accuracy just by predicting class 0 all the time — but it fails to detect any class 1 cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Misleading Accuracy\n",
        "Accuracy becomes misleading in imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "A high accuracy might hide the fact that the model is failing to detect the minority class, which is often the class of interest (e.g., fraud, disease, defects).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 3. Poor Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for Minority Class\n",
        "Recall for the minority class may be very low because the model misses many true positives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision may also suffer if false positives are frequent.\n",
        "\n",
        "F1 Score, which balances precision and recall, typically exposes the poor performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 4. Probability Calibration Gets Skewed\n",
        "The predicted probabilities (from the sigmoid function) are biased toward the majority class, making it harder to apply a meaningful threshold for decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is Hyperparameter Tuning in Logistic Regression?\n",
        " - Hyperparameter tuning in logistic regression is the process of selecting the best set of configuration values (hyperparameters) that are not learned directly from the training data but can greatly impact model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What are different solvers in Logistic Regression? Which one should be used?\n",
        " - In logistic regression, solvers are optimization algorithms used to minimize the cost function and find the best model parameters (coefficients). Different solvers are suited to different types of data and regularization. Common solvers include liblinear, lbfgs, newton-cg, sag, and saga. The liblinear solver is good for small datasets and supports L1 and L2 regularization, making it a solid choice for binary classification with simple data. lbfgs and newton-cg are better for larger datasets and support only L2 regularization but work well for multiclass problems using the \"multinomial\" option. sag and saga are efficient for large datasets as they use stochastic gradient approaches; saga also supports L1, L2, and Elastic Net penalties, making it the most flexible solver for sparse or high-dimensional data. Choosing the right solver depends on the dataset size, type of regularization, and whether the classification problem is binary or multiclass. For most general purposes, lbfgs is recommended due to its efficiency and support for multiclass classification, unless L1 regularization is specifically needed, in which case saga or liblinear should be used.\n",

        "15. How is Logistic Regression extended for multiclass classification?\n",
        " - Standard logistic regression is designed for binary classification (i.e., two classes: 0 or 1). To handle multiclass classification (three or more classes), it must be extended. The most common approaches are:\n",

        "Trains one binary classifier per class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each class, the model distinguishes that class from all other classes combined.\n",
        "\n",
        "✔️ When to Use:\n",
        "When you prefer interpretability — you can analyze each class’s model separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "If classes are not mutually exclusive or there's overlap between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using algorithms that are naturally binary (e.g., SVM, logistic regression with multi_class='ovr').\n",
        "\n",
        "For small to medium datasets where model simplicity is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Limitations:\n",
        "May be less accurate when classes are strongly related or not independent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separate models may give inconsistent probabilities (not summing to 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔸 Softmax (Multinomial Logistic Regression):\n",
        "✅ How it works:\n",
        "Trains a single model that directly assigns probabilities to each class using the softmax function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classes are treated as mutually exclusive.\n",
        "\n",
        "✔️ When to Use:\n",
        "When the classes are clearly distinct and mutually exclusive.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you want probabilities that sum to 1 across classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "For larger or more complex datasets — often gives better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you're using solvers like 'lbfgs' or 'saga' with multi_class='multinomial'.\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Limitations:\n",
        "May be less interpretable than OvR.\n",
